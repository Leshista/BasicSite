## course, if we don't count pure HTML one

### Firstly I'll try to do all the work myself w/o tutorial, only w/ mockup, then I'll see tutorial and correct mistakes, if nesessary
### Also, I'll be using BEM system for the first time here, and I already know in theory about responsivness, but will add it as soon as meet it on the course and will try to use flexbox and preprocessor SASS, yet to be seen on the course
#### P.S. Test project itself will be avaible via a footer link, the main page is different
