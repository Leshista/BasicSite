## The 1st of 9 projects of the 
# The Result-Oriented Web Developer Course - BOOTCAMP 2021
## course, if we don't count pure HTML one
---
### Firstly I'll try to do all the work myself w/o tutorial, only w/ mockup, then I'll watch tutorial and do the second page
### Also, I'll be using BEM system for the first time in project here, so as flexbox and preprocessor SASS, yet to be seen on the course. I already know in theory about responsivness, but will add it as soon as meet it on the course 
#### P.S. Test project itself will be avaible via a footer link, the main page is different
